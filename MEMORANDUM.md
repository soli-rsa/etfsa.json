MEMORANDUM

TO: The Investment Committee FROM: Senior Investment Strategist DATE: October 2025 SUBJECT: Analysis of Actively Managed Exchange-Traded Products (AMETFs & AMCs)

1. Introduction

The purpose of this memorandum is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the landscape of JSE-listed Actively Managed Exchange Traded Funds (AMETFs) and Actively Managed Certificates (AMCs). The actively managed segment of the exchange-traded product market has expanded significantly, offering a diverse range of strategies that warrant the Committee's attention. This document synthesizes the stated investment objectives and strategies of these products to inform our future strategic allocation decisions and to identify potential opportunities for alpha generation and portfolio diversification. This analysis is based exclusively on the product data available as of October 2025.

2. Analysis of Actively Managed Exchange Traded Funds (AMETFs)

Actively Managed ETFs represent a compelling evolution in investment product design. They are hybrid vehicles that offer the potential for alpha generation and risk management inherent in active security selection, combined with the structural benefits of a traditional exchange-traded fund, namely intra-day liquidity, transparency, and administrative efficiency. The universe of AMETFs on the JSE now spans multiple asset classes and strategic mandates.

2.1. Equity-Focused AMETFs

2.3. Thematic and Sector-Specific AMETFs

A growing number of AMETFs provide targeted exposure to secular growth themes, such as technology and healthcare, as well as specific sectors like global property.

The diversity of strategies—from core global equity to targeted thematic and income-focused mandates—demonstrates the versatility and growing maturity of the AMETF structure.

3. Analysis of Actively Managed Certificates (AMCs)

Actively Managed Certificates are distinct from AMETFs. They are structured debt instruments, where the return is linked to the performance of an underlying, actively managed reference portfolio. This structure provides investors with access to a wide array of highly specialized, often boutique, active management strategies that may not be available through more conventional fund structures.

3.1. South African Equity Focused AMCs

Several AMCs are explicitly focused on generating returns from the domestic equity market, often through concentrated, high-conviction portfolios.

Portfolio Name & Ticker	Portfolio Manager	Stated Objective & Strategy	Return Structure
Melville Douglas SA Inc AMC (AMC021)	Melville Douglas	A focused portfolio of 10-12 JSE-listed companies primarily exposed to the SA economy.	TR

3.2. Global & Offshore Equity AMCs

3.3. Multi-Asset & Niche Strategy AMCs

This group of AMCs provides access to unique and specialized strategies that go beyond traditional long-only equity, including long/short positions, special situations, and balanced mandates.

Portfolio Name & Ticker	Portfolio Manager	Stated Objective & Strategy	Return Structure

The AMC wrapper is clearly being utilized to bring highly specialized, concentrated, and often manager-specific strategies to the listed market.

4. Key Strategic Considerations for the Investment Committee

Having outlined the available products, this section moves from description to synthesis. The purpose is to distill the preceding data into actionable insights and strategic questions relevant to the Committee's portfolio construction and manager selection processes.

4.1. AMETFs vs. AMCs: A Structural and Strategic Comparison

Based on the provided product descriptions, AMETFs and AMCs occupy different, albeit sometimes overlapping, positions in the investment landscape.

AMETFs	AMCs
- Broad Mandates: Typically offer strategies like broad global equity, multi-asset (including Regulation 28), and income generation.	- Specialized & Niche Mandates: Often provide access to concentrated, high-conviction, or unique strategies (e.g., long/short, special situations, brand-focused).
- Institutional Distribution: Primarily offered by larger asset managers, often packaging their flagship institutional or retail fund strategies for the exchange.	- Access to Specialists: Frequently provides access to the specific, often concentrated, strategies of boutique or specialist portfolio managers not otherwise available in a fund format.
- Fund Structure: Often structured as Collective Investment Schemes (CIS) or feeder funds investing into underlying UCITS funds.	- Note Structure: Described as structured debt instruments where returns are linked to a reference portfolio's performance.
- Distribution Options: Offer a mix of distributing (Quarterly, Annual, etc.) and total return (accumulating) policies.	- Total Return Focus: The return structure across all listed AMCs is Total Return (TR), meaning all income is reinvested.
- Hybrid Structures: Includes strategies that blur active/passive lines by tracking systematic, non-market-cap-weighted indices (e.g., thematic, factor-based).	

4.2. Dominant Investment Themes

Across both product types, several prominent investment themes emerge, providing a framework for potential portfolio allocations.

1. Global Diversification and Core Exposure Many products are designed to serve as core holdings for accessing global markets. They offer broad diversification across developed and emerging market equities, often managed by established institutional firms.
  * Examples: Coronation Global Equity Select Prescient Feeder AMETF (COGES), Boutique Global Equity Portfolio AMC (BAMGCF).
2. Thematic Technology and Innovation A significant number of products provide targeted exposure to secular growth megatrends, particularly in technology. These strategies focus on companies at the forefront of innovation, such as artificial intelligence and the 4th Industrial Revolution.
  * Examples: EasyETFs AI World AMETF (EASYAI), Sygnia Itrix 4th Industrial Revolution AMETF (SYG4IR).
3. Concentrated South African Opportunities For investors seeking high-conviction domestic exposure, several managers offer concentrated portfolios of JSE-listed companies. These strategies move beyond broad index tracking to focus on specific themes like quality, mid-caps, or companies geared towards the local economy.
  * Examples: Melville Douglas SA Inc AMC (AMC021), Advantage Solutions SA Quality Core Portfolio AMC (SAQUAL).
4. Targeted Income Generation A key objective for many investors is yield, and this is addressed through products that actively manage portfolios of fixed income, credit, and high-dividend-paying securities across both local and offshore markets.
  * Examples: 10X Income AMETF (INCOME), High Street Offshore Yielding Portfolio AMC (AMC002).

4.3. Implications for Portfolio Allocation

This analysis presents the Committee with a rich opportunity set but also requires careful consideration. The following questions should guide our discussion on integrating these products into our strategic and tactical asset allocation frameworks:

* Given our macro outlook, should we favor the broad, diversified mandates typical of multi-asset AMETFs, or should we allocate to the more concentrated, high-conviction strategies offered through AMCs?
* How does the manager-specific risk inherent in single-strategy AMCs, often run by boutique firms, fit within our existing risk management and due diligence framework?
* Which thematic exposures, such as artificial intelligence, healthcare innovation, or global brands, align with our long-term growth objectives and justify a tactical allocation?
* For our income-focused mandates, do the actively managed fixed-income AMETFs offer a compelling alternative to our existing passive and direct bond holdings?

5. Conclusion and Proposed Next Steps

This memorandum confirms that the JSE offers a robust and diverse ecosystem of actively managed investment products through both the AMETF and AMC structures. These vehicles provide access to a wide spectrum of strategies, from core institutional-grade portfolios to niche, specialist mandates, suitable for a variety of portfolio objectives. They represent a viable toolkit for enhancing diversification, targeting specific themes, and seeking alpha.

To capitalize on these findings, the following next steps are proposed:

* Identify specific strategies from this analysis that align with the firm's current macro-economic outlook and client portfolio needs.
* Authorize the creation of a formal shortlist of high-interest products for subsequent quantitative and qualitative due diligence, including an analysis of fees, tracking error (where applicable), and manager track record.
* Schedule deep-dive sessions to review the shortlisted products in the next Investment Committee meeting.
