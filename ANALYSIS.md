# Market Analysis: A Comparative Overview of Domestic and Foreign ETFs on the JSE

1.0 Introduction to the ETF Investment Landscape

This report provides a structured comparison of South African (Domestic) and Foreign Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) available to investors on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), based on comprehensive data as of October 2025. The primary purpose of this analysis is to categorize and detail the extensive range of available funds, creating a clear framework to aid investors and financial analysts in their evaluation and decision-making processes. By segmenting the market into distinct, understandable categories, this document illuminates the strategic options available for achieving specific investment objectives, from broad market exposure to targeted sector and thematic investing.

The scope of this analysis is centered on traditional, passively managed ETFs that track a specified index. However, it is important to acknowledge that the JSE also lists a variety of other Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), including Actively Managed ETFs (AMETFs), Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), and Actively Managed Certificates (AMCs). An overview of these alternative structures is provided in the Appendix for a more complete market context.

We will begin by examining the diverse landscape of domestic ETFs, which offer direct exposure to the South African economy.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.0 Analysis of Domestic (South African) ETFs

Investing in domestic ETFs offers a direct proxy for the health and trajectory of the South African economy. This section deconstructs the available toolkit, moving from foundational, broad-market exposure to the surgical precision of sector-specific and factor-based strategies, allowing for direct participation in the country's growth and performance. These funds range from ETFs tracking broad market indices like the Top 40 to those offering precise exposure to specific JSE sectors, fixed income instruments, and alternative investment styles.

2.1 Broad Equity Market Access

These ETFs are the cornerstone for investors seeking diversified exposure to the largest and most liquid companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. They track well-known South African equity indices, including the FTSE/JSE Top 40, the JSE All Share, and the Next 40, offering a single, cost-effective instrument to invest in the broader market.

Fund Name	JSE Ticker	Investment Focus
1nvest Top 40 ETF	ETFT40	Tracks the market capitalization of the Top 40 JSE-listed companies.
1nvest SWIX Capped ETF	ETFSWX	Tracks a shareholder-weighted adjusted Top 40 index.
10X Wealth Next 40 Equal Weighted ETF	WNXT40	Provides equal-weighted exposure to JSE companies ranked 21-60 by market cap.
10X Wealth Top 20 Capped ETF	WTOP20	Offers exposure to the 20 largest companies on the JSE.
FNB Top 40 ETF	FNBT40	Tracks the JSE Top 40 index.
Satrix 40 ETF	STX40	Tracks the market cap index of the Top 40 blue-chip shares on the JSE.
Satrix SWIX Top 40 ETF	STXSWX	Adjusts the Top 40 weighting to exclude shares held by foreigners, which reduces the portfolio's exposure to mining and dual-listed shares.
Sygnia Itrix Top 40 ETF	SYGT40	Tracks the market cap index of the Top 40 blue-chip shares on the JSE.
10X S&P SA Top 50 ETF	CTOP50	Tracks the S&P Top 50 index, including some mid-cap companies not in Top 40 indices.
Satrix Capped All Share ETF	STXCAP	Holds all 140 shares in the JSE All Share index, with a 10% cap on any single share.
Satrix JSE Global Equity ETF	STXJGE	Tracks the FTSE/JSE Global Equity Index, consisting of the top 50 JSE companies ranked by investable market cap.

A key differentiator for investors to note within this category is the weighting methodology. Standard market-capitalization weighted funds like the Satrix 40 ETF (STX40) reflect the total market value of companies, which can lead to high concentration in mining and dual-listed stocks. In contrast, shareholder-weighted (SWIX) indices, such as the one tracked by the Satrix SWIX Top 40 ETF (STXSWX), adjust for foreign ownership, providing a portfolio that is more representative of the holdings of South African investors and typically has a lower exposure to the resources sector.

2.2 JSE Sector-Specific Exposure

For investors wishing to capitalize on the performance of specific segments of the South African economy, sector-specific ETFs offer a targeted approach. These funds allow for concentrated investments in areas such as financials, resources, industrials, or mid-cap companies.

Fund Name	JSE Ticker	Investment Focus
FNB MidCap ETF	FNBMID	Tracks the FTSE/JSE MidCap index of 61 companies, ranked 43 to 103 on the JSE.
Satrix Capped INDI ETF	STXIND	Provides access to the top 25 industrial shares (manufacturing, construction, retail) on the JSE.
Satrix FINI 15 ETF	STXFIN	Offers exposure to local banks, insurance, and financial services companies.
Satrix RESI 10 ETF	STXRES	Provides a portfolio of the top 10 mining and resource counters on the JSE.

2.3 Fixed Income and Interest Rate ETFs

This category of ETFs provides exposure to the South African debt market. Investors can access a portfolio of government and corporate bonds, as well as instruments that track floating interest rates like money market deposits, serving as tools for income generation and portfolio diversification.

Fund Name	JSE Ticker	Investment Focus
Satrix TRACI 3 Month ETF	STXTRA	Provides the return of a 3-month money market deposit with monthly interest reinvestment.
1nvest SA Bond ETF	ETFBND	Tracks the S&P South Africa Sovereign Bond 1+ Year Index of local currency government debt.
10X Wealth GOVI Bond ETF	CSGOVI	Tracks the FTSE/JSE All Bond Government Index (GOVI).
10X Yield Selected Bond ETF	CSYSB	Tracks the South African Yield Selected Nominal Bond Index for income and capital growth.
FNB Government Inflation-Linked Bond ETF	FNBINF	Offers exposure to SA Government Inflation-Linked Bonds to protect capital and interest against CPI.
Satrix GOVI ETF	STXGVI	Tracks the FTSE/JSE All Bond Government Index (GOVI).
Satrix ILBI Bond ETF	STXILB	Tracks an index of SA Rand-denominated inflation-linked securities issued by the government.
Satrix SA Bond Portfolio ETF	STXGOV	Tracks the S&P South Africa Sovereign Bond 1+ Year Index of Rand-denominated government bonds.

2.4 Listed Property ETFs

These funds offer a convenient and liquid way to invest in the South African real estate market. By holding a portfolio of JSE-listed property companies and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), these ETFs provide exposure to rental income streams and potential capital appreciation from the underlying property assets.

Fund Name	JSE Ticker	Investment Focus
1nvest SA Property ETF	ETFSAP	Invests in the FTSE/JSE SAPY index of 22 listed property shares.
10X SA Property Income ETF	CSPROP	Tracks the SA Property Income Index, with an emphasis on higher-yielding property companies.
Satrix SA Property ETF	STXPRO	Tracks a market-value-weighted index of 15 top property companies, with individual weights capped at 10%.

2.5 Style, Smart Beta, and Fundamental Value ETFs

Moving beyond traditional market-cap weighting, these ETFs track indices constructed based on specific factors or investment styles. This "smart beta" approach allows investors to target characteristics such as high dividend yield, low volatility, quality, momentum, or fundamental value metrics like price-to-earnings ratios, offering alternative sources of return.

Fund Name	JSE Ticker	Investment Strategy
Satrix DIVI ETF	STXDIV	Selects 30 JSE companies based on their dividend payment potential for the upcoming year.
Satrix Inclusion & Diversity ETF	STXID	Tracks 30 JSE-listed companies that demonstrate and promote inclusion and diversity in the workplace.
Satrix Low Volatility ETF	STXLVL	Tracks an index of 20 highly liquid JSE securities that exhibit the lowest volatility and beta.
Satrix Momentum ETF	STXMMT	Tracks an index that tilts towards equities displaying positive momentum and away from those with negative momentum.
Satrix Quality South Africa ETF	STXQUA	Tracks an index of South African stocks rated by a quality score (return on equity, accruals, leverage).
Satrix Shari'ah Top 40 ETF	STXSHA	Invests in a basket of Top 40 shares selected using Islamic investment principles.
Satrix Value Equity ETF	STXVEQ	Tracks an index of 30 liquid JSE securities that exhibit value characteristics (low P/E and P/B ratios).

Having reviewed the domestic offerings, we now turn our attention to the opportunities available through ETFs focused on international markets.

3.0 Analysis of Foreign ETFs

Investing in foreign ETFs listed on the JSE is a crucial strategy for South African investors seeking to build globally diversified portfolios. These instruments provide seamless access to international growth engines and global megatrends like technology and healthcare, which have a limited footprint on the JSE. Furthermore, they offer exposure to industries underrepresented in the local market and serve as a potential hedge against the depreciation of the Rand. This section details the foreign ETFs available, categorized by asset class and investment strategy.

3.1 Broad Equity Market Access

This is the largest and most popular category of foreign ETFs, offering investors diversified exposure to global, regional, or country-specific equity markets. These funds track major international indices such as the MSCI World, S&P 500, and MSCI Emerging Markets, often utilizing a "Feeder Fund" structure to invest in large, liquid international ETFs.

Sygnia Itrix MSCI China Feeder ETF	SYGCN	Tracks the S&P New China Sectors Index, which focuses on consumption and service industries, notably differing from other China ETFs that track the broader MSCI China Index.

The significant number of ETFs tracking the S&P 500 and MSCI World indices is a notable feature of the JSE market. This duplication provides investors with a wide range of choices from different asset managers. However, it also necessitates a deeper level of due diligence beyond the fund name. Critical differentiators such as Total Expense Ratios (TERs), tracking error, and the specific underlying UCITS ETF being used become paramount in selecting the most efficient vehicle for the desired exposure. A full analysis of these metrics is beyond the scope of this overview but represents a critical next step for investors.

3.2 Foreign Bond ETFs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4.0 Specialized Exposure: Commodity ETFs

Commodity ETFs provide investors with a straightforward and efficient way to gain direct exposure to the price movements of physical commodities. These instruments are distinct from equity or bond investments, offering a powerful diversification tool for a portfolio. They allow investors to participate in the performance of precious metals like gold and platinum without the complexities of storing and insuring the physical assets. For a South African investor, returns are a function of both the change in the underlying commodity's US Dollar price and the fluctuation of the ZAR/USD exchange rate.

Commodity	Fund Name	JSE Ticker	Investment Method
Gold	1nvest Gold ETF	ETFGLD	Invests directly in physical gold bullion, offering exposure to the gold price in rands.
Palladium	1nvest Palladium ETF	ETFPLD	Invests directly in physical palladium bullion, offering exposure to the palladium price in rands.

5.0 Key Differentiators and Investment Considerations

Synthesizing the preceding analysis, this section highlights the critical factors that investors should consider when selecting an ETF. Understanding these differentiators in dividend policies, investment structures, and strategic objectives is essential for interpreting the available data and making informed decisions that align with individual portfolio construction goals.

Dividend Policies

An ETF's dividend policy is a key determinant of its suitability for different investor profiles. The dividend frequency indicates how income is handled within the fund:

* Quarterly (Q), Bi-Annually (Bi-A), Monthly (M), Bi-monthly: These codes signify income-distributing funds. The ETF collects dividends or interest from its underlying holdings and pays them out to investors at regular intervals. These are well-suited for investors seeking a consistent cash flow stream from their investments.
* Total Return (TR): This indicates that all income, such as dividends or interest, is automatically reinvested back into the fund. This strategy compounds returns over time and is ideal for investors focused on long-term capital growth rather than immediate income.
* No Dividend (ND): This is characteristic of commodity ETFs that invest in physical assets like gold or platinum. As these underlying assets do not generate income, the ETF's return is derived exclusively from changes in the commodity's market price and currency fluctuations.

Investment Structures

A key structural difference exists between most domestic and foreign ETFs listed on the JSE. Domestic ETFs typically hold the underlying South African shares or bonds directly, precisely replicating the composition of their target index. In contrast, many foreign ETFs operate as Feeder Funds. A feeder fund does not buy the individual international securities itself; instead, it invests all or most of its assets into a single, larger, internationally domiciled ETF (e.g., an iShares or Vanguard ETF). This structure simplifies access for local investors, providing a Rand-denominated vehicle to invest in global markets without needing to manage foreign currency transactions or open offshore accounts. However, while it simplifies access, it can introduce an additional layer of fees (from the underlying fund) and potential tracking differences that investors must be aware of.

Strategic Objectives

The choice between domestic and foreign ETFs fundamentally depends on an investor's strategic goals. Each category serves distinct, though sometimes complementary, purposes within a diversified portfolio.

Domestic (SA) ETFs	Foreign ETFs
Targeted exposure to local economic growth.	Global market and geographic diversification.
Investment in specific JSE sectors like Resources or Financials.	Access to global technology, healthcare, and consumer brands.
Access to SA government and corporate debt for income.	Hedging against Rand depreciation and local market volatility.
Building a core portfolio centered on the local market.	Participation in global economic trends and growth engines.

In essence, domestic ETFs are tools for expressing a view on the South African market, while foreign ETFs are tools for diversifying away from it, creating a balanced and resilient investment portfolio.

Having considered these key factors, we can now draw a conclusion on the ETF market landscape.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6.0 Conclusion

This market analysis demonstrates the significant depth and diversity of both Domestic and Foreign Exchange Traded Funds available on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The local market provides a comprehensive toolkit for investors to gain exposure to South African equities, bonds, property, and specific investment factors. Simultaneously, the extensive range of foreign ETFs offers a simple and effective gateway to global diversification, enabling investment in the world's largest economies, key international sectors, and emerging megatrends.

Ultimately, the choice between these categories, and the specific funds within them, is not a matter of one being superior to the other. Instead, it depends entirely on an investor's individual financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and desired market exposure. Whether the objective is to participate in local economic growth, generate a Rand-based income, or hedge against currency risk and access global innovation, the JSE's ETF ecosystem provides a robust set of instruments to achieve it.

This analysis serves as a foundational guide for navigating the available options and should form the basis for further, more detailed due diligence into the specific ETFs that align with an investor's strategic objectives.

Appendix: Overview of Other Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)

Beyond the traditional, passively managed ETFs that form the core of this analysis, the JSE also lists other Exchange Traded Product (ETP) structures. These include Actively Managed ETFs (AMETFs), Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), and Actively Managed Certificates (AMCs), which offer different risk-return profiles and investment strategies. This appendix provides a brief overview of each.

A.1 Actively Managed ETFs (AMETFs)

Unlike passive ETFs that track a specific index, Actively Managed ETFs (AMETFs) have a dedicated portfolio manager or management team making active investment decisions. The goal of an AMETF is to outperform a specific benchmark or achieve a particular investment objective (e.g., income generation or capital growth) through security selection and market timing. Investors choose AMETFs in the hope that a manager's expertise will generate alpha, but this comes at the cost of higher fees and the risk of underperformance compared to a passive index.

* 10X Income AMETF (INCOME): This fund is an actively managed portfolio consisting of South African fixed interest and inflation-linked bonds, local and offshore credit instruments, and money market assets.
* EasyETFs AI World AMETFF (EASYAI): This AMETF aims for capital appreciation by investing primarily in foreign equities that the manager believes will benefit from the creation, adoption, and utilization of artificial intelligence.
* Sygnia Itrix 4th Industrial Revolution AMETF (SYG4IR): The objective of this portfolio is to provide access to the Kensho New Economies Composite Index, which seeks to capture economic sectors propelling the “4th Industrial Revolution."

A.2 Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs)

Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) are debt instruments issued by a financial institution, typically a bank. They promise to pay investors the return of a specific index or strategy, minus fees. A key distinction is that ETNs do not hold the underlying assets; their value is backed by the creditworthiness of the issuer. This introduces issuer credit risk, meaning if the issuing bank were to face financial difficulty, the value of the ETN could be compromised. Therefore, the financial stability of the issuing bank (e.g., FNB, Absa) is a primary due diligence point when considering an ETN. The JSE lists a wide variety of ETNs, offering access to single international stocks, themed indices, currencies, and commodities.

* FNB Apple - C ETN (APETNC): This ETN provides investors with exposure to the performance of Apple Inc. stock, an American multinational technology company.
* Bloomberg Luxury Series 1 NRI EUR ETN (ULUXSE): This ETN tracks the Bloomberg Luxury Series 1 Net Return Index, which provides exposure to 19 of the most important companies in the global luxury market.
* Absa NewWave USD ETN (NEWUSD): This ETN provides an investment in US Dollar deposits, with the price movement reflecting the Rand/US Dollar exchange rate. Interest accrues daily and is included in the ETN price.

A.3 Actively Managed Certificates (AMCs)

Actively Managed Certificates (AMCs) are structured products linked to the performance of a reference portfolio. This portfolio is actively managed by a portfolio manager according to a specific strategy, which can range from long/short equity positions to global growth or income-focused mandates. AMCs offer access to specialized, active strategies in a listed, tradable format.

* AAM Multi Strategy Equity Portfolio AMC (AMC001): This strategy aims to generate alpha with lower volatility by exploiting market inefficiencies. It targets capturing 70% of market upside while limiting participation in downturns to 30%.
* High Street Offshore Yielding Portfolio AMC (AMC002): The mandate is to identify global multinational companies that generate significant cash flows for recurring dividend payments or share buybacks. It may also use high-yielding government and corporate bonds.
* AnBro Titans Portfolio AMC (TITANS): This portfolio focuses on investing in the largest and most successful company in eleven different industries within the US S&P index, aiming to hold dominant industry leaders.
